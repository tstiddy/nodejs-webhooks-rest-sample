# Microsoft Graph Webhooks Sample for Node.js
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/microsoftgraph/nodejs-webhooks-rest-sample.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/microsoftgraph/nodejs-webhooks-rest-sample)

This Node.js sample shows how to start getting notifications from Microsoft Graph. The following are common tasks that a web application performs with Microsoft Graph webhooks.

* Sign-in your users with their work or school account to get an access token.
* Use the access token to create a webhook subscription.
* Send back a validation token to confirm the notification URL.
* Listen for notifications from Microsoft Graph.
* Request for more information in Microsoft Office 365 using data in the notification.

## Screenshots

1. First you need sign in.

2. Once signing in, the app will listen to the incoming emails.

3. After sending the email to the address, you will see the email in the app.

## Prerequisites

To use the Webhook sample, you need the following:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 4 or 5.
* An app registered in Microsoft Azure. You can use the [Office 365 app registration tool](http://dev.office.com/app-registration). It simplifies app registration. Use the following parameters:

|     Parameter   |              Value             |
|----------------:|:-------------------------------|
|        App type | Web App                        |
|     Sign on URL | http://localhost:3000          |
|    Redirect URI | http://localhost:3000/callback |
| App permissions | Mail.Read                      |
  
  Copy and store the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values.
     
## Configure a tunnel for your localhost

The sample uses *localhost* as the development server. For this reason, we need a tunnel that can forward requests from a URL on the Internet to our *localhost*. If for any reason, you don't want to use a tunnel, see [Hosting without a tunnel](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-Nodejs-Webhooks/wiki/Hosting-the-sample-without-a-tunnel). If you want a detailed explanation about why to use a tunnel, see [Why do I have to use a tunnel?](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-Nodejs-Webhooks/wiki/Why-do-I-have-to-use-a-tunnel)

For this sample, we use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create the tunnel. To configure ngrok:

1. [Download](https://ngrok.com/download) and unzip the ngrok binaries for your platform.
2. Type the following command:
    
    `ngrok http 3000`
    
3. Take note of the *https public URL* that ngrok provides for you. This is an example:

    `https://NGROK_ID.ngrok.io`

You'll need the *NGROK_ID* value in the next section.

## Configure and run the web app

1. Use a text editor to open `constants.js`.
2. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID* with the client ID of your registered Azure application.
3. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_SECRET* with the client secret of your registered Azure application.
4. Replace *NGROK_ID* with the value in *https public URL* from the previous section.
5. Install the dependencies running the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

6. Start the application with the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    > Note: You can also make the application wait for a debugger. To wait for a debugger, use the following command instead:
    ```
    npm run debug
    ```
    You can attach the debugger included in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging).
    
7. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
